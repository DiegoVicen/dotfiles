* How to install

Most of the configuration is performed automatically as long as all the
relevant packages to do so are installed. Please do take into account that the
next section describes the parts that are not performed automatically. The
script can be run using:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
sudo ./setup.sh
#+END_SRC

* Things not automated yet

** Touchpad configuration

Find the device using =sudo libinput list-devices= and then search for its
configuration file in =/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/=. You should find something like
this:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
[dvicente@soyuz ~]$ tree /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
├── 00-keyboard.conf
├── 50-synaptics.conf
└── 99-killX.conf
#+END_SRC

In this case, =50-synaptics.conf= is the configuration file for the trackpad in
an XPS15 9570 laptop. The relevant lines to add to the active option in it (you
will have to use your detective skills here, mine was =touchpad catchall=) are:

#+BEGIN_SRC conf
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "touchpad catchall"
        Driver "synaptics"
        [...]
        # Enable tap-to-click
        Option "Tapping" "on"
        # Enable natural (reverse) scrolling
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"
        [...]
EndSection
#+END_SRC
